# BestGig
BestGig app is the creatio of John "KJ" Idehai. It is a freelancing and crowdsourcing platform that enables members to post and bid for projects.

The concept is simply to allow the general public to register as members on the app, selecting the skill category under which they propose to offer services. All duly registered members are then able to update their profile, view each other's profile, post new projects (or adhoc jobs), bid for projects, select preferred bidder and commit payment in-app immediaetly the project execution is confirmed.

This is my work-in-progress and is put in my public directory to shcowcase my abilities with PHP OOP, MySQLi databases and Javascript / JQuery.

Thank you.
